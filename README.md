this is a read me file that i have made for vagrant project.
i am writing this from my local computer using git bash.


steps that i had too.

i created a repo "zero_day" on github GUI.
i set descreption to it
i created a dirctory with the same name on my desktop
i then intalize git in it (git init) ............... this mean the directory becomes a local repo 
then, added a remote orgin where i can push later to with the command git add remote.
(this is basically linking the directoery that i have created now with the remote repo/ u can refer as to the cloud )

                git add remote takes two arguments 1. the name of the new repo
                                                   2. the URL of the repo we have created on the user interface.... we get this by coping from the git GUI on github.com
